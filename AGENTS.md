# Unhinge Agent Guidelines

## 1. Operational Rules

1. **Zero comments**: Never write comments in production code.
2. **No hardcoded obfuscated symbols**: Never hardcode obfuscated class names, method names, or field names. Resolve them dynamically via DexKitResolver or rely on stable public/proto contracts.
3. **No tests in production**: Do not write tests for the production codebase.
4. **Clean workspace**: Clean up all temporary scripts, scratch files, and dumps immediately after use.
5. **Clean architecture & idioms**: Follow modern Kotlin and Android best practices. Keep changes minimal and concise: install and use the [ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md) skill to keep work minimal and clean.
6. **Thorough refactoring**: When replacing or refactoring logic, remove all superseded code and accompanying artifacts across all layers. Leave no dead paths or legacy baggage.
7. **Validation**: Validate changes with `./gradlew assembleDebug`. Ensure the build passes before finishing.
8. **Client-side containment & server leakage minimization**: Prefer local client-side evaluation and containment wherever possible to minimize upstream server leakage and account risk. When feature enablement or other workarounds require outbound or network-level interception, isolate the changes, exercise caution against attestation mismatches, and avoid leaking spoofed product attributes into general telemetry, analytics, or sync payloads.

## 2. Framework & Stack Context

- **Hooking**: Modern LibXposed (API 101/102+), never legacy XposedBridge APIs.
- **Deobfuscation**: Runtime bytecode indexing using DexKit.
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3.
- **IPC / Config**: RemotePreferences via PreferencesManager.

## 3. Hooking Philosophy & Methodology

Hinge is an obfuscated target under active R8 churn. Hooks must be resilient to updates:

- **Match semantic invariants, not obfuscated identity**: Short names and numeric instruction offsets are reconnaissance artifacts only. Match stable strings, interface contracts, or proto definitions.
- **Resolve capabilities, not versions**: Detect behavior and structure dynamically from the APK rather than hardcoding version codes.
- **Prefer one deep semantic resolver**: Consolidate logic into one robust resolver rather than accumulating release-specific fingerprints.
- **Fail closed**: An unexpected signature, zero matches, or ambiguous resolution must raise a useful exception; never silently skip required behavior or guess.
- **Validate resolved elements**: Assert returned types and signatures before attaching hooks. "The first iget-object after the key" is not proof.
- **Leave no dangling stubs**: Optional resolvers must never leave live extension placeholders or no-op interceptors behind.
- **Hook the minimal surface at the latest safe point**: Intercept the smallest value at the point of control rather than modifying broad caller pipelines.
- **Prefer local read sites**: Where feasible, hook local readers and feature consumers rather than modifying broad outbound pipelines. When network-level or client spoofing is required, isolate overrides to the minimal necessary endpoint surface.
- **Avoid mutating shared utilities**: Do not modify common helpers if they serve unrelated features.

## 4. Refactoring & Complete Logic Replacement

When refactoring or superseding existing logic, cover all bases and completely eliminate the previous implementation across the entire codebase:

- **No dual/dead execution paths**: Eradicate replaced hooks, interception pipelines, and transitional fallback branches completely. Never allow obsolete hooks to run alongside new ones.
- **Purge orphaned constants and helpers**: Delete companion object constants (RPC paths, service names, intent actions), private helper functions, reflection caches, and parameters that only served the retired code.
- **Clean resolver signatures and cache**: Remove unused signature keys (`KEY_*`) and search routines from `DexKitResolver`. Ensure no obsolete cache entries or invalid fallback signatures linger.
- **Prune UI, prefs, and registrations**: If a toggle or feature is retired, remove its entry from `HookRegistry`, `PrefKeys`, settings screens, and `strings.xml`.
- **Audit all reference sites**: Grep for all usages of touched classes, methods, and constants before completing the task to ensure no orphaned references or dead imports remain.
